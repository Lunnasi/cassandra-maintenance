= Simple Cassandra Maintenance Script =

This is a simple Cassandra maintenance script meant to be run as a cron job

The script performs 3 basic operation that should be automated in a Cassandra
ring. The operations are:
- repair
- compact
- cleanup

The script should be run preferably between two gc_grace_period timeframe, in
order to make sure that the entire ring is in a good shape (basically that
deletes have been propagated).

By default it logs messages in '/var/log/cassandra/', in the file
'maintenance.log'. The log directory can be passed as an argument to the script

For more info, use 'cassandra-maintenance -h'.
